# Meteor.sh

## What?

Meteor.sh is a simple Shellscript to setup a Meteor server and deploy Meteor apps to it.

## Why?

Because deploying to custom servers should be as simple as everything else in Meteor.

## Awesome, tell me what to do.

### Before we start:

Meteor.sh assumes that you have some kind of Ubuntu-Server and root access to it.

Move the `meteor.sh` file into your project dir and change the `APP_HOST` variable.

Meteor.sh will try to SSH as root to `APP_HOST`.

#### A note on EC2 support:

If your server happens to be an Amazon EC2 instance, uncomment the `EC2_PEM_FILE` variable and point it to your pem file. Meteor.sh will then do the right things for those instances.

This version of the script also depends on the AWS EC2 Tools being installed locally and available in your PATH.

### Install the server:

```
./meteor.sh setup
```

This will install Node, Mongo and other dependencies for Meteor and Meteor.sh on `APP_HOST`.

### Deploy your app:

```
./meteor.sh deploy
```

Deploys your app to the server and starts it as a service.

## Meteorite support

Meteor.sh will detect if your project uses Meteorite and use it accordingly.
